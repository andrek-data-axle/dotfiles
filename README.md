These are a few of my files from my home directory.
Normally hidden files have the `.` removed.

# oh-my-zsh
install oh-my-zsh in ~/oh-my-zsh
ln is ~/platform/dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
you will also need to recreate .zshrc_aws

## vim/nvim
ln -s ~/platform/dotfiles/init.vim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/platform/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
