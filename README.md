These are a few of my files from my home directory.

Normally hidden files have the `.` removed.

## oh-my-zsh
install oh-my-zsh in ~/oh-my-zsh
you will also need to recreate .zshrc_aws with aws credentials

```
ln -s ~/platform/dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

## vim/nvim
```
ln -s ~/platform/dotfiles/init.vim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/platform/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
